= Improving the OpenIndiana Website


== Just some general thoughts.....

* The current OI website is a marked improvement over what previously existed.
But anything that is already good can be further improved.
* Wondering if we can expand on the Hipster name, perhaps by theming the website in a similar manor.
** Hipster denotes something trendy, or in fashion, etc., the website theme should exploit this in some way.
*** Could try something some like big fashionable buttons as follows:

|===
| Button label | URL points to

| Get it 
| Hipster Downloads

| Install it 
| Installation Guidance/Tutorials/Instructions

| Use It 
| Hipster Handbook

| Discuss it 
| OI Mailing lists/IRC, etc.

| Extend It 
| Developer Handbook

=== Favicon
* Can we add the OI favicon to Wordpress like we see on the wiki?


=== Mobile Devices
* Maybe we should put something on the front page mentioning the mobile menu which is available in the upper left hand corner.
** Due to the dark blue color scheme, this menu is hard to see and easily missed.
** Can the color of the 3 bars be changed to white or something?


=== Other Thoughts
* Add some links to the Community > Getting Involved page.

//[Already listed there but maybe it is more a matter of reorganizing the content for better readability - alarcher ]//

* Have redirects (mailing lists, illumos links, etc., ) open into a new tab so OI webpage remains open.

* Update Roadmap page and move it underneath some other tab.
//[I disagree on this one, it is important to have the roadmap as visible as possible, especially for a projet like OI that many call dead - alarcher ]//

* Move link to WIKI to a more prominent location (e.g. its own first level tab on home page). Wiki is currently listed last under documentation.
//[Agreed but after the Wiki is turned into something else than a pile of obsolete or unstructured info. Currently I do not want to direct people to this mess - alarcher]//

* More frequent updates to Latest News.
//[Agreed but need people to write them... - alarcher]//

* Community > Security Advisories is misleading.
This only leads to page to report problems, not view already reported advisories as the breadcrumbs would suggest.

* Update Documentation > FAQ

* Documentation > Gallery - Lets update the screenshots - should be from Hipster.

* Update Packages page to include SFE and other repos (along with information and what is and isn’t compatible).
//[Done - alarcher]//

* Disable WordPress pingbacks.
They don’t look to offer any real value (e.g. the download page has 68 pingbacks).
//[Already disabled, these are oldies - alarcher]//

* A support forum like Ubuntu or Mint, etc.
People have been leaving (largely unanswered) comments on Wiki in lieu of a support forum.
//[Opening comments on this Wiki is an error in the first place - alarcher]//

* Blog aggregator
* Post old Solaris docs (as they are updated)
* Export XML/HTML to PDF and EPUB books.

* Add list of mirrors, torrents, etc., to download page on website.
** Need to find more places to mirror, preferably some in north america too.
