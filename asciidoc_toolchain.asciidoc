=== Docs are Code

The most important thing to keep in mind is that docs = code.
So, we treat the docs just as we would code.

* Write 1 sentence per line.
* Use comments in your docs.
* Use version control - fork and fix.

=== General writing tips

* Write your docs by answering a question.
** Later turn the questions into sectional headings, etc.
* Use a thesaurus - e.g. https://www.powerthesaurus.org/
* Couch read - via a phone or tablet, proof read what you previously wrote. - (puts you into the reader's shoes)

=== Tips for working with Asciidoctor

* Use "Attributes" and name space them - e.g. `:uri-project: <url>` -(place these attributes at top of document)
** Call your attributes in your docs like this: `{uri-project} [Project name]`
* Use "Includes" - e.g. `include:: {uri-macros}/doc_to_import.asciidoc[]` - (allows you to pull in other docs into your docs)
