== Considerations and ideas for further improving the OI WordPress website.

=== Just some general thoughts.....

* The current OI website is a marked improvement over what previously existed. But anything that is already good can be further improved.
* Wondering if we can expand on the Hipster name, perhaps by theming the website in a similar manor.
** Hipster denotes something trendy, or in fashion, etc., the website theme should exploit this in some way.
*** Could try something some like big fashionable buttons as follows:

|===
| Button label | URL points to

| Get it 
| Hipster Downloads

| Install it 
| Installation Guidance/Tutorials/Instructions

| Use It 
| Hipster Handbook

| Extend It 
| Developer Handbook

| Discuss it 
| OI Mailing lists/IRC, etc.

=== Favicon
* Can we add the OI favicon to Wordpress like we see on the wiki?


=== Mobile Devices
* Maybe we should put something on the front page mentioning the mobile menu which is available in the upper left hand corner.
** Due to the dark blue color scheme, this menu is hard to see and easily missed.
** Can the color of the 3 bars be changed to white or something?

=== Other Thoughts
* Add some links to the Community > Getting Involved page.

//[Already listed there but maybe it is more a matter of reorganizing the content for better readability - alarcher ]//

* Have redirects (mailing lists, illumos links, etc., ) open into a new tab so OI webpage remains open.

* Update Roadmap page and move it underneath some other tab.
//[I disagree on this one, it is important to have the roadmap as visible as possible, especially for a projet like OI that many call dead - alarcher ]//

* Move link to WIKI to a more prominent location (e.g. its own first level tab on home page). Wiki is currently listed last under documentation.
//[Agreed but after the Wiki is turned into something else than a pile of obsolete or unstructured info. Currently I do not want to direct people to this mess - alarcher]//

* More frequent updates to Latest News.
//[Agreed but need people to write them... - alarcher]//

* Community > Security Advisories is misleading. This only leads to page to report problems, not view already reported advisories as the breadcrumbs would suggest.

* Update Documentation > FAQ

* Documentation > Gallery - Lets update the screenshots - should be from Hipster.

* Update Packages page to include SFE and other repos (along with information and what is and isn’t compatible).
//[Done - alarcher]//

* Disable WordPress pingbacks. They don’t look to offer any real value (e.g. the download page has 68 pingbacks).
//[Already disabled, these are oldies - alarcher]//

* A support forum like Ubuntu or Mint, etc. People have been leaving (largely unanswered) comments on Wiki in lieu of a support forum.
//[Opening comments on this Wiki is an error in the first place - alarcher]//

* Blog aggregator

* [partially complete] -- Publish man pages online
** Core man pages are available on illumos.org
** Perhaps there are some OI specific man pages which need to be published as well. [e.g. PKG(5) is missing]
** [comment from OI-DEV IRC - 
*** <leoric> looking at Ubuntu dhcp.conf online man page, I thought it would be good to have automatic extractor and search interface, extracting man pages from package repository and publishing them on OI site...
***<alanc> http://illumos.org/man/ covers the illumos ones, but not all the other packages
***<leoric> I know about illumos man pages, but thought about all available man pages
***<alanc> yeah, I figured that's what you meant
*** <leoric> new dhcpd seems to be working...

* Post old Solaris docs (as they are updated)

* Export XML/HTML to PDF and EPUB books.

* Updated Custom desktop background for OI - Perhaps downloads from the website, or included in distro.
//[I would love that. Also I want to publish new pictures for Community and Roadmap every 6 months]//

* Updated Custom splash screen for grub
//[That is if GRUB stays our bootloader - alarcher]//

* Add list of mirrors, torrents, etc., to download page on website.
** Need to find more places to mirror, preferably some in north america too.
