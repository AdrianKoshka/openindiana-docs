= OI evangelism

=== This page is a bucket list of ideas and suggestions for promoting the OpenIndiana distro


* Updated distro info on Distrowatch (currently showing hipster 2105.03 as most current). Also remove references to dead /dev branch.
** //I contacted Distrowatch to update to info to 2015.10 and provided and updated list of package versions.// - [alarcher]
** //Verified Distrowatch has updated their package info, etc.// - [makruger]
** //Some version numbers are still incorrect, for the next round I provided a mapping from DistroWatch to Hipster names http://hub.openindiana.ninja/?q=content/distrowatch-openindiana-hipster-packages[here]// - [alarcher]
* other distro related websites:
** http://opensolaris.linuxfreedom.com/ - didn't see OpenIndiana here anywhere (still showing OpenSolaris)
* Feed periodic updates to Slashdot, phoronix, UnixMen, etc.
** //Even if the pertinence of such benchmarks is questionable, we should add the Phoronix Test Suite to oi-userland as indicator.// - [alarcher]
