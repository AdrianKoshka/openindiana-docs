= OI evangelism

=== This page is a bucket list of ideas and suggestions for promoting the OpenIndiana distro


* Updated distro info on Distrowatch (currently showing hipster 2105.03 as most current). Also remove references to dead /dev branch.
** I contacted Distrowatch to update to info to 2015.10 and provided and updated list of package version. - [alarcher]
** Verified Distrowatch has updated their package info, etc. - [makruger]
** Some version numbers are still incorrect, for the next round I provided a mapping from DistroWatch to Hipster names http://hub.openindiana.ninja/?q=content/distrowatch-openindiana-hipster-packages[here] - [alarcher]
* other distro related websites:
** http://opensolaris.linuxfreedom.com/ - didn't see OpenIndiana here anywhere (still showing OpenSolaris)
* Feed periodic updates to Slashdot, phoronix, UnixMen, etc.
** Even if the pertinence of such benchmarks is questionable, we should add the Phoronix Test Suite to oi-userland as indicator. - [alarcher]

=== Hipster news
* Current events with OI Hipster distro
* OI/illumos news stories
* Featured new packages
* Tips and Tricks

=== OI Selling points
* The desktop is really what makes OI unique among all the different illumos distributions. 
** The project should really capitalize on the desktop
*** Even though OI makes for a great server, the server space is dominated by OmniOS, SmartOS; OI will struggle competing there.
** Aim not just for parity with PC-BSD or FreeBSD, but usability parity with Linux Mint.
* 47 keyboard layouts, 22 languages - All Illumos have this though, so not really unique among illumos

=== Software wish list to make the desktop more usable

==== Development tools
* ATOM - Text Editor
* Eclipse IDE
* GVIM - Text Editor
* Meld - Diff Viewer

==== Desktop publishing
* Scribus or inkscape

==== Photography
* Darktable
* RawTherapee
* Picasa

==== Suggestions for improving elements of the distro itself

* Updated Custom desktop background for OI - Perhaps downloads from the website, or included in distro.
* Updated Custom splash screen for grub (or Forth bootloader)
