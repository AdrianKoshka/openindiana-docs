== OI evangelism

* Updated distro info on Distrowatch (currently showing hipster 2105.03 as most current). Also remove references to dead /dev branch.
** //I contacted Distrowatch to update to info to 2015.10 and provided and updated list of package versions.// - [alarcher]
** //Verified Distrowatch has updated their package info, etc.// - [makruger]
** //Some version numbers are still incorrect, for the next round I provided a mapping from DistroWatch to Hipster names [[http://hub.openindiana.ninja/?q=content/distrowatch-openindiana-hipster-packages|here]]// - [alarcher]
* other distro related websites:
** http://opensolaris.linuxfreedom.com/ - didn't see OpenIndiana here anywhere (still showing OpenSolaris)
* Feed periodic updates to Slashdot, phoronix, UnixMen, etc.
** //Even if the pertinence of such benchmarks is questionable, we should add the Phoronix Test Suite to oi-userland as indicator.// - [alarcher]

== OI Selling points
* The desktop is really what makes OI unique among all the different illumos distributions. I'd say the project should really capitalize on that. 
* 47 keyboard layouts, 22 languages.

== Software wish list to make the desktop more usable

\\

=== Desktop publishing
* Scribus or inkscape

=== Photography
* Darktable
