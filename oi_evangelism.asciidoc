= OI evangelism

=== Suggestions for promoting and or improving the OpenIndiana distro

==== OI Selling points
* The desktop is really what makes OI unique among all the different illumos distributions. 
** The project should really capitalize on the desktop
*** Even though OI makes for a great server, the server space is dominated by OmniOS, SmartOS; OI will struggle competing there.
** Aim not just for parity with PC-BSD or FreeBSD, but usability parity with Linux Mint.
* 47 keyboard layouts, 22 languages - All Illumos have this though, so not really unique among illumos


==== Public Relations
* Distrowatch
** I contacted Distrowatch to update to info to 2015.10 and provided and updated list of package version. - [alarcher] 
** Some version numbers are still incorrect, for the next round I provided a mapping from DistroWatch to Hipster names http://hub.openindiana.ninja/?q=content/distrowatch-openindiana-hipster-packages[here] - [alarcher]
* http://opensolaris.linuxfreedom.com/ - didn't see OpenIndiana here anywhere (still showing OpenSolaris)
* Unixmen
* Slashdot
* Phoronix
** Even if the pertinence of such benchmarks is questionable, we should add the Phoronix Test Suite to oi-userland as indicator. - [alarcher]
