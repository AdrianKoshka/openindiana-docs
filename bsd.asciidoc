= What characteristics of the FreeBSD & PCBSD websites and handbooks make them helpful and attractive?

\\
 
== PCBSD 
*website: http://www.pcbsd.org/
** Well laid out, clutter free.
** Download buttons are present right on home page. 
** Hosted on WordPress (using WP_Emoji plugin)

*handbook: http://web.pcbsd.org/doc-archive/10.2/html/pcbsd.html
** Nice intuitive navigation pane on left side - (Newer versions allow navigation pane to be toggled out of the way)
** Clutter free as it only shows one section at a time.
** Lots of color, bold text, large fonts, lots of screen shots, etc.
** Breadcrumbs on top, but not on bottom.

*example of their handbook page source: http://web.pcbsd.org/doc-archive/10.2/html/_sources/install.txt
** Very simple [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html | reStructuredText markup]] - Similar to ASCIIDOC or Creole

\\

== FreeBSD 
* website - https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/
** well defined and well organized navigational dropdowns
** Lots of color used to delineate one piece of information from another
** Very consistent style used throughout entire website

* Handbook - https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/book.html
** Red text used for hyperlinks
** grey boxes used to delineate columns of information from each other.
** Each page has it's own navigational breadcrumbs (top and bottom, left and right)

\\

==What can we learn from this?

* The PCBSD Project is using [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html | Sphinx]] for their handbook.
** Python Project also uses restructuredtext based Sphinx for their documentation (you'll notice the similarities).
** Skill level required for contributing to docs project is much lower than it would be for docbook

* The FreeBSD Project is using [[http://www.docbook.org/ | Docbook]] for their handbook.
** Sun used solbook (derived from docbook). Redhat most likely uses Docbook as well.
** Skill level required to contribute to docs project is somewhat higher than it would be for restructuredtext based Sphinx.

* Both projects are hosting their handbooks as static HTML pages.

* The PCBSD handbook is searchable (uses several javascripts to do this). The FreeBSD handbook is not searchable.
