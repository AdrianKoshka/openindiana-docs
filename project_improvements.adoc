= Improving the OpenIndiana Project


[NOTE]
====
For expert community building guidance from a seasoned OpenSolaris veteran, see https://jimgrisanzio.wordpress.com/communities/[Jim Grisianzio's communities page].

== Governance Board

At this time the OpenIndiana project does not have a formal governance board.
Creating a formal governance board would help steer the OpenIndiana project.


== Code of Conduct

At this time the OpenIndiana project does not have a formal code of conduct.
Creating a formal code of conduct would be a healthy step towards ensuring harmony within the project.

== Public Relations

Public relations is an important aspect of project management, even if it's limited to updating 3rd party websites as to the current status of the project.

.3rd party websites to keep updated
- Distrowatch
* For the next Distrowatch update, there is a mapping from DistroWatch to Hipster names:
* http://hub.openindiana.ninja/?q=content/distrowatch-openindiana-hipster-packages[here] - [alarcher]
- http://opensolaris.linuxfreedom.com/ - didn't see OpenIndiana here anywhere (still showing OpenSolaris)
- Unixmen
- Slashdot
- Phoronix

.Hipster News
- Current events with OI Hipster distro
- OI/illumos news stories
- Featured new packages
- Tips and Tricks

.Download mirrors
- Some of the currently listed mirrors are offline or outdated.
* Need to update the landing pages for some of the mirrors.
- Really need a North American mirror.

== Other Periodic Website Updates
- Publish new pictures for the Community and update the Roadmap every 6 months


== Software wish list to make the desktop more usable

- The desktop is really what makes OpenIndiana Hipster unique among all the different illumos distributions. 
* The project should really capitalize on the desktop, and by extension include lots of GUI software.

== Suggestions for improving elements of the distro itself
- Updated Custom desktop background for OI - Perhaps downloads from the website, or included in distro.
- Updated Custom splash screen for grub (or Forth bootloader)
- Updated "Welcome to Opendiana" desktop page.
