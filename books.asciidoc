= OpenSolaris Redistributable Books

== Current Situation
* The source for the PDL licensed restributable books is Solbook XML 3.5 (and in some cases Solbook XML 3.6).
Solbook is a creation of Sun Microsystems and is a simplified subset of Docbook.
We have a conversion tool (written in JAVA) which can handle the conversion of Solbook XML 3.5 to HTML 4.5, but we do not have DTD's for any other XML versions (e.g 3.6). 
** Assuming the differences between these Solbook XML versions are not too great, we might be able to trick the java conversion tool by simply changing the version number within the DTD (This is speculative and not yet been tried).
* We have the source for the 2009.06 book, but not for the 2008.11 books.
It's not really known whether the 2009.06 include everything found in the 2008.11 books.

== Challenges for working with the OpenSolaris Books
* The OpenSolaris books all reference each other using the original SUN hosted URL's.
** Even the illumos books have broken sun links (thus also need some love).
* The books have difficult to decipher folder and xml file names.
* The books are not particularly mobile friendly
** Single page HTML or multipage with embedded page navigation is generally more friendly - e.g. FreeBSD Handbook)
* The Solbook to html conversion tool chain (JAR) is broken (indexing does not work).
** Conversion and deployment of the books is a manual process.
** We have no automated way to maintain these books (no automated toolchain exists).
* XML is hard to read, hard to edit, and requires validation after editing.
* In regard to the factual correctness of the documentation, do we ourselves even know what still works, doesn't work, has been deprecated, replaced, etc.?

== Future Direction
* We should consider converting the OpenSolaris books to some kind of simple text based markup (e.g. ASCIIDOC, restructured text, Markdown, etc.).
Using a text based markup would greatly lower the bar for working on the books.
* For books for which we do not have the XML source, perhaps pandoc can be used to reconvert the HTML back to text markup.
* We need to create a fully automated toochain with the following features:
** Source code stored on GITHUB.
** Commit hooks kick off an automated conversion (build) and deployment of the books to their public location.
** We need to determine where to host the books - (e.g. OI website, Github pages, readthedocs.com, etc.)
** Docs maintenance process needs to be fully documented.

Another consideration is printing.
There should be printer friendly CSS used with the HTML pages. 

=== What are other projects doing?

* In a nutshell, they're not using wiki's.
Instead they're doing it all with static HTML.
* Whatever documentation build system we end up using....it should be natively supported on OI (and ideally cross platform to both Windows and Linux as well).

[PC-PCD]
* The PC-BSD Project uses the python based Sphinx toolchain (which is based on restructured text).
* The FreeBSD project uses Docbook 5 along with a semi-automated XML toolchain to validate and convert the source code to other formats.

[FreeBSD]
* The FreeBSD project hosts their Docbook 5 XML source in a single subversion repository where you check out the entire project.
* For more details of the FreeBSD docs process, see: https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/index.html
